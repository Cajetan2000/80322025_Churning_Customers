# 80322025_Churning_Customers

This project is a deployed Multilayer Peceptron model that predicts the churning of customers. The main contribution of this work is to develop a churn prediction model that assists telecom operators in predicting customers who are most likely subject to churn. I have defined and trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron model using the Functional API
and evaluated the modelâ€™s accuracy as well as the AUC score.

Find attached the link to a video explaining how to use the model:
